We spent this week engineering.

We spent it fixing bugs, refactoring code, and writing plenty more. We spent it arguing over import ordering, debating service interfaces, and defining API shapes. 

Our actual progress was substantial — it was a good week with much headway made, but rather than recite the nitty-gritty of what we did, I thought it more interesting to write about the act of: engineering.

I’ll caveat that this is opinionated. \
Many engineers tend to be quite pedantic (the sort to write blogs) and it seems that I am no exception to the rule. 

Engineering is changing, and there is much talk, and anxiety, about what the future of the field is. 
But rather than proclaim yet another vision as to what it will be, I want to record a perspective on what it was.

I want to write it here: a perspective on what it means to be a good engineer. \
So without ado.


&nbsp;

## 1. Good engineers care

They care about code. \
They care about variable names, they care about formatting, they care about structure. They want their code to be clean — for it to be legible and for it to be elegant. They get incredibly irritated if it is not: dirty code drives them crazy. And though they know it's irrational, they feel the compulsion to refactor code incessantly.

They also care about _how_ to write code. \
This includes things like editors, (e.g., Vi vs Emacs), things like languages (e.g., Python vs Ruby), and things like methodologies (e.g., TDD). Their opinions may differ, but it is certain that they will have one, and a strong one at that.

And it goes without saying, but they care about _what_ their code does. \
They care about how fast it is, they care about how reliable it is, they care about what it can, what it cannot, and what it should and should not do.

They get emotional over it. The thought of their code not functioning the way they intended gives them intense shame. The thought of someone using their code in a way that they didn’t anticipate may peeve them. But above all, the thought of their code being unused makes them sad.

&nbsp;

## 2. Good engineers are right, a lot

They can tell at a glance when something is wrong. \
When asked a question, they often reply immediately and are almost always right too. But they know when they don’t know — and even more so than they take pride in being right, they are paranoid of being wrong.

That is, they believe that there is a right and there is a wrong. \
They believe themselves to be objective and their continual pursuit is to find the optimal solution, the _best_ solution given the constraints. 

They tend to hate the subjective, the fields in which there is no right answer, and often attempt to either impose a system of order where it doesn’t exist or abandon it entirely. This also makes them rather fierce debate partners.

Mikkel is a good example of this. \
It is annoying to argue with Mikkel because I usually end up realizing that I am wrong. But it is also undeniably useful to.

&nbsp;

## 3. Good engineers have taste

They have good hunches. \
They choose the right abstractions for the right problems, recognizing when a one-off edge case is symptomatic of a larger pattern and when a seemingly costly feature can be solved by a simple hack. 

They know when to do things properly, when to spend time building systems that scale, and when to hack, when to do the simplest thing possible as quickly as possible. This also implies that they know how to do both and how to do both well.

They have some sense of how long code will last — and rather than attempt to always build
the perfect solution, recognize that the best solution is defined by the context of its asks.

Taste is probably hardest to define, but a few examples are Git, recognizing that a distributed VCS _is_ open-source, Rust, an eclectic language that makes best  memory management practices mandates, and Claude Code, which rather than introducing new abstractions for code, was simply built around UNIX commands.


&nbsp;

It is an open question as to how the above will change, and what the definition of a good engineer will be, but as of now, I see no reason to revise.
