# gitdot

**1. What is gitdot?**

A better GitHub. \
An opinionated tool for quality open-source software. \

**2. Who is gitdot for?**

Open-source maintainers. \
People who see code as more than a means to an end, but as a craft to perfect. The software they build serves the world — but the software they use doesn't serve them.

**3. What problem does gitdot solve?**

A monopoly. \
Open-source software only has one competitive platform: GitHub. And while GitHub *is* an impressive product, we also know that a lack of competition enables degradation over time. There's a few pain points we're keenly aware of (e.g., CI) and make it our mission to build a better open-source alternative.

**4. What features will gitdot have?**

- A hyper-performant Git server written in Rust.
- A sane CI/CD platform that is secure by design and locally testable.
- An issue tracker designed to serve the maintainer, not the submitter.

We will not have feature parity, but from the get go, our product will be reliable. \
It will stink of quality — and deliver a superior experience for a handful of customers.

**5. What features will gitdot not have?**

- No AI copilot.
- No vanity stars.
- No free private repos.

We view AI as an implementation detail, not as a feature. We also question some of the paradigms present in open-source and ask whether features like stars truly serve the maintainer. And finally, public repos will be free, but private repos will be paid for.

**6. When will gitdot be ready?**

March 31st, 2026. \
Every week, we will publish a developer log to detail not only our progress, but our thinking in full. These will be strikingly forthright; we want the *why* behind our product decisions to be critiqued and understood.

---

We recognize that we're making some bold claims here and we're not so naive as to think this will be easy. \
Building software is hard — but it is simply what we love doing.
